This repository is my attempt at the [CodeCrafters Redis Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis). The goal of this project is to implement a basic Redis clone, while learning some C++.

Why Redis? Because I will cry if I have to implement another boring CRUD application as a personal project.

If you're wondering what sider means, try spelling it backwards.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have `cmake` installed locally.
2. Run `./spawn_redis_server.sh` to run the Redis server.
